/**
 * Epic #470 W1 — the daemon's job-policy client (spec §4, review finding S3).
 *
 * The daemon NEVER takes a job's execution policy from its caller. `POST
 * /v1/jobs` carries only `{ protocol, jobId, leaseTtlSec }`; the effective
 * policy (image, env, egress allowlist) is fetched HERE, from the middleware's
 * internal endpoint, authenticated with the daemon token:
 *
 *   GET <MIDDLEWARE_URL>/api/v1/dev-runner/internal/job-policy/:jobId
 *   Authorization: Bearer <DEV_RUNNER_DAEMON_TOKEN>
 *
 * The middleware derives it from the `dev_repos` row (`deriveJobPolicy`), so
 * "the caller names a job; it never supplies a policy" is enforced across the
 * whole path, not merely at the daemon's schema boundary.
 *
 * DEFENCE IN DEPTH (review round-3, high finding). The middleware is a SEPARATE
 * privilege domain: it holds Vault and the LLM credentials, the daemon holds the
 * dind engine. A courier that runs whatever image the middleware names would
 * collapse those two domains — a compromised or spoofed middleware could then
 * run an arbitrary image inside dind. So the policy the middleware returns is
 * treated as UNTRUSTED input and clamped here, daemon-side:
 *
 *   - the image REPOSITORY must be in `DEV_RUNNER_ALLOWED_IMAGES` (an operator
 *     allowlist the daemon refuses to start without — see `parseAllowedImages`);
 *   - the image must be DIGEST-PINNED (`repo@sha256:<64hex>`) when
 *     `DEV_RUNNER_REQUIRE_DIGEST` is on (default true) — a floating tag is
 *     mutable and is refused;
 *   - the policy `env` must carry ONLY keys on an explicit ALLOWLIST — the exact
 *     set the runner legitimately needs (`ALLOWED_ENV_KEYS`); anything else is
 *     refused by key name;
 *   - the runner's identity/location/CLI keys are DAEMON-OWNED
 *     (`DAEMON_OWNED_ENV_KEYS`: `OMADIA_CLI_BIN`, `OMADIA_JOB_BASE_URL`,
 *     `OMADIA_JOB_ID`, `OMADIA_WORKSPACE`) — each is an execution or phone-home
 *     redirection sink, so a policy that carries one is refused loudly and the
 *     daemon INJECTS its own value instead (`injectDaemonOwnedEnv`). Only
 *     `OMADIA_JOB_TOKEN` stays policy-supplied, and with the base URL now pinned
 *     by the daemon it can no longer be aimed at an attacker host.
 *
 * Any violation throws `PolicyLookupError` BEFORE the policy reaches
 * `createJobContainer`, so no container is ever created from a rejected policy.
 *
 * The response shape is validated against the middleware's real return
 * (`devRunnerJobPolicyRoute.ts` — `{ jobId, image, env, egressAllowlist }`)
 * with a local zod schema; a malformed or truncated policy is refused rather
 * than fed to container creation. The body read is BOUNDED (byte cap) and
 * TIMED (the abort signal stays armed across the whole request, headers AND
 * body), so a peer that dribbles or floods the body fails fast.

 * families alone already carry command-execution sinks (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`,
 * `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`, `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD`,
 * `LD_AUDIT`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, …). A compromised or spoofed middleware — this
 * unit's stated adversary — needs only ONE such key to get arbitrary execution
 * on the next `git`/shell invocation, and every tool the runner image later
 * gains (ssh, make, perl) silently adds more. A denylist cannot enumerate that
 * moving target; an allowlist refuses it by construction. This is the same
 * lesson the W0 shim env (`readShimEnv`) and the W1 egress-proxy headers already
 * learned: name what you accept, refuse everything else.
 *
 * The set is the exhaustive union of what the runner legitimately needs FROM THE
 * POLICY, derived from the code on this branch:
 *   - the policy-supplied shim inputs (`packages/dev-runner-shim/src/protocol.ts`
 *     `readShimEnv`): the job TOKEN only — the base URL, job id, workspace and CLI
 *     bin are DAEMON-OWNED (`DAEMON_OWNED_ENV_KEYS`), injected here and never
 *     accepted from the policy — plus the gated LLM-passthrough pair in `index.ts`;
 *   - LLM + CLI behaviour keys emitted/consumed by
 *     `src/devplatform/deriveJobPolicy.ts` and the Claude CLI;
 *   - benign locale/tooling keys.
 *
 * The egress-proxy vars (`HTTP(S)_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`, both spellings) are
 * deliberately ABSENT: they are DAEMON-OWNED (`DAEMON_OWNED_ENV_KEYS`), not
 * policy-supplied. Unlike `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, which only steers LLM traffic the
 * middleware already owns the credentials for, the proxy vars are a GENERIC
 * egress-routing lever — they redirect EVERY http(s) client in the container,
 * git included. A compromised middleware that could set `HTTPS_PROXY` at its own
 * host would route the runner's clone, its SCM-token exchange and its diff upload
 * through the attacker. The egress proxy's address is deployment topology (a
 * static IP the daemon knows from its own config), never per-job policy, so the
 * daemon injects it (`DEV_RUNNER_EGRESS_PROXY_URL` / `DEV_RUNNER_NO_PROXY`) and
 * refuses a policy that carries one.
 * `deriveJobPolicy` today emits only a small subset; the rest are admitted so a
 * legitimate future policy is not rejected — the point of the clamp is to refuse
 * the DANGEROUS unknown, not every unknown the derivation might grow into.

 *     it; a policy value like `./pwn` would run an attacker binary from the
 *     cloned repo. The daemon injects its configured CLI (`DEV_RUNNER_CLI_BIN`,
 *     default `claude`).
 *   - `OMADIA_JOB_BASE_URL` — the shim's `homeClient` builds every phone-home URL
 *     (and the bearer header) from it; a policy value like `https://attacker`
 *     would send the runner's spec fetch, SCM-token fetch, events, diff and
 *     result to the attacker. The daemon injects its own middleware base URL.
 *   - `OMADIA_JOB_ID` — identifies the job to the middleware; must be the daemon's
 *     UUID-validated job id, not a value the middleware can skew.
 *   - `OMADIA_WORKSPACE` — where the repo is cloned; must be the container's fixed
 *     workspace path, not a policy-chosen directory.
 *   - `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` (and their lowercase spellings, plus
 *     npm's own `npm_config_proxy` / `npm_config_https_proxy` / `npm_config_noproxy`) —
 *     the container-wide egress-routing lever. A policy value would redirect every
 *     http(s) client in the container (clone, SCM-token exchange, diff upload,
 *     git, node, curl, npm) through an attacker-chosen proxy. The egress proxy's
 *     address is deployment topology the daemon knows from its own config, so the
 *     daemon injects it (`DEV_RUNNER_EGRESS_PROXY_URL` / `DEV_RUNNER_NO_PROXY`)
 *     and never accepts it from the policy. Every spelling is owned because
 *     curl/libcurl honour the lowercase names, git/node the uppercase ones, and
 *     npm's own config layer resolves `npm_config_*` before either — admitting
 *     any one from the policy would reopen the lever the others close.
 *
 * A policy that CARRIES any of these is not a legitimate policy — it is a
 * compromised or spoofed middleware. So we REJECT it loudly (`assertPolicyEnv`)
 * rather than silently overwrite, then inject the daemon-owned values
 * (`injectDaemonOwnedEnv`). `OMADIA_JOB_TOKEN` is intentionally NOT here: the

/**
 * Epic #470 W1 — job registry + the container-lifecycle seam (spec §4, §7).
 *
 * TWO things live here:
 *
 *  1. `JobManager` — the daemon's in-memory registry of live jobs and the
 *     idempotency authority for `POST /v1/jobs`. It fetches the server-derived
 *     policy (via the injected policy client), asks the engine to create the
 *     container, and records the handle. A second create for a live job returns
 *     the EXISTING record and never asks the engine for a second container; a
 *     create already in flight is de-duplicated so two concurrent requests still
 *     produce one container (review lesson: idempotency is a create-time
 *     property, not an after-the-fact cleanup).
 *
 *  2. `ContainerEngine` — the seam the container lifecycle hangs off. This unit
 *     ships the SCAFFOLD; the hardening-clamp unit drops the real dockerode
 *     `create/start` (with the §4 clamp) in behind this same interface, and the
 *     tests here drive a fake. `createDockerEngine` wires a real dockerode client
 *     to dind over TLS and implements `ping` (which `/v1/health` needs now);
 *     the mutating lifecycle methods throw `EngineNotImplementedError` until the
 *     clamp unit fills them, so an accidental early call fails loudly.
 *
 * SEAM CONTRACT — `ContainerEngine.createJobContainer({ jobId, policy,
 * leaseExpiresAt, extraHosts })`: given a job id, the SERVER-DERIVED
 * `DerivedJobPolicy` (image/env/egressAllowlist, fetched by the daemon —
 * never caller-supplied), the computed lease expiry, and ALREADY-RESOLVED
 * `host:ip` entries for the allowlist (JobManager#provision resolves them via
 * the proxy client — the engine has no route of its own to the internet),
 * create and start ONE hardened container and return its `{ containerId,
 * networkId, volumeName, imageDigest }`. The clamp, per-job network, and
 * workspace volume are the implementation's responsibility; the JobManager
 * only stores what it returns.

 * the CONNECT tunnel. Confirmed live: a direct `dns.lookup()` inside a job

 * (127.0.0.11) has no upstream for external names (spec §6's "DNS-exfil
 * defence": the job network has no route to a real resolver by design). Hit
 * for every concurrent package fetch, this triggers npm's own confirmed
 * ExitHandler re-entrancy race (npm/cli#9751, "Exit handler never called!").
 * Any tool doing local resolution of an allowlisted host hits the same
 * wall — this fixes it at the root rather than chasing npm's internals.
 *
 * The resolution itself MUST go through the proxy's `resolveHosts` (not the
 * daemon's own DNS) — confirmed live that the daemon container is ALSO on an
 * isolated network with no internet route; only the egress proxy is. Batched
 * into ONE call rather than per-host, since the proxy is reachable but the
 * daemon otherwise has no network dependency on it for anything but this.
 *
 * A host that fails to resolve here is skipped, not fatal — the CONNECT
 * tunnel path (the proxy's own, independent resolution) still works for it
 * regardless; this is a best-effort improvement to LOCAL resolution, not a
 * new correctness requirement for egress itself. An IP literal in the
 * allowlist is skipped too — nothing to pre-resolve, and it would be a

/**
 * Epic #470 W1 — lease reaper, orphan sweep, boot-time state rebuild (spec §7).
 *
 * THIS UNIT CLOSES THE GAP EVERY PRIOR AUDIT NOTED: `leaseExpiresAt` was recorded
 * and renewed but never ENFORCED. A wedged or compromised middleware could create
 * allowed-image jobs and leave dind resources pinned indefinitely, because the
 * daemon only ever tore a container down when the middleware ASKED (DELETE). The
 * reaper makes the daemon self-authoritative for containers: the two-sided
 * authority the spec's §7 table demands — the daemon lease reaper is authoritative
 * for containers (survives middleware death); the middleware `reap()` for DB state.
 *
 * Three jobs, one periodic timer:
 *
 *  1. LEASE ENFORCEMENT — every sweep, any LIVE registered job whose lease has
 *     passed is torn down through the EXACT same path as a DELETE
 *     (`JobManager.destroy`): deduplicated per id, cleanup proven before the
 *     record is forgotten, a failed teardown surfaced and the handle RETAINED for
 *     the next sweep. There is no second teardown here (hard-won lesson (a): never
 *     drop the only handle on a live resource before its removal is proven).
 *
 *  2. BOOT-TIME STATE REBUILD — on start the daemon rebuilds its registry from the
 *     engine: every labelled container is re-adopted (so a daemon restart does not
 *     orphan a live job), and any adopted job already past its lease is reaped as
 *     `boot_stale`.
 *
 *  3. ORPHAN SWEEP — labelled containers/networks/volumes with NO corresponding
 *     tracked job are removed, including the partial network/volume a failed
 *     `createJobContainer` rollback could not clear (they carry the deterministic
 *     `omadia-job-<id>` names and this daemon's label). A resource whose id is
 *     still tracked — live OR mid-create — is never touched (lesson (a): a
 *     provisioning job's resources exist before its record lands in `#jobs`).
 *
 * The timer is unref'd and single-flighted: a slow pass never stacks on the next
 * tick, and a hung engine call cannot pin the process open or wedge the daemon
 * (lesson (d) — the tests must not hang). Every reap logs the job id and the
 * reason (`lease_expired` | `lifetime_exceeded` | `orphan` | `boot_stale`) so a
 * reap is observable.

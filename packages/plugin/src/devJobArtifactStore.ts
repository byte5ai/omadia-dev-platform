/**
 * Epic #470 W0 — `dev_job_artifacts` access, split out of `DevJobStore` to keep
 * both files under the repo's 500-line rule.
 *
 * Standalone functions over a `Pool` rather than a second class: they carry no
 * state, and `DevJobStore` delegates so callers keep a single store surface.
 *
 * `kind` is validated here rather than by the database. Migration 0022
 * deliberately dropped the CHECK on `dev_job_artifacts.kind` — the enum grows
 * in W1 through W3 — so TypeScript is the only enforcement left.

/**
 * Epic #470 W0 — DevJobStore: the durable job spine (spec §4).
 *
 * Queue state lives in Postgres from day one — deliberately NOT the builder's
 * in-memory `BuildQueue` — so a restart never orphans a job. Claim/lease mirrors
 * `conductor/runStore.ts`: `claimNextQueued` grabs one queued row with `FOR
 * UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, stamping a `randomUUID()` lease into `claimed_by`; every
 * subsequent WORKER write is fenced `WHERE claimed_by = <lease>` (0 rows ⇒
 * `DevJobLeaseLostError`, cf. `RunLeaseLostError`). Terminal transitions are NOT
 * here: `finishTerminal` is brand-gated so `finalizeDevJob.ts` is the one choke
 * point. Repo CRUD lives in `devRepoStore.ts` (file-size split).

/**
 * Epic #470 W0 — the `RunnerBackend` seam (spec §3/§4).
 *
 * The canonical wire shapes (`RunnerBackend`, `RunnerHandle`,
 * `DevJobProvisionInput`) live in `./types.ts` next to the rest of the
 * DB-mirrored contract; this module is the backend-facing entry point. It
 * re-exports the seam so backends and the worker import ONE module, and adds
 * the two things only backends need:
 *
 *   - `DevJobProvisionContext` — `provision()` deliberately receives pointers,
 *     not secrets (the runner pulls its own spec), but a backend must still be
 *     able to REFUSE a job it may not run. The context carries exactly the two
 *     admission facts that decision needs (`source`, `repo.runsTests`) and
 *     nothing else. The worker supplies them from the claimed job + repo row;
 *     a backend fails closed when they are missing (see
 *     `assertProvisionContext`), so a caller cannot skip admission by passing
 *     the bare pointer shape.
 *
 *   - `RunnerBackendError` — a typed refusal. Backends live below the HTTP
 *     layer, so this is NOT the routes' `DevPlatformError` (no status code);
 *     callers map `code` to a transport error themselves. Codes share the
 *     `devplatform.` prefix used everywhere else.

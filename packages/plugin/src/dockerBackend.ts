/**
 * Epic #470 W1 — `DockerBackend`: the middleware's client for the runner daemon
 * (spec §4/§5). It supersedes the W0 `LocalProcessBackend` as the shipping
 * execution path; the local backend is demoted to a `DEV_PLATFORM_UNSAFE_LOCAL`
 * escape hatch (see `wireDevPlatform.buildBackends`).
 *
 * The whole point of this backend is that IT IS THE CALLER, and a caller never
 * dictates policy. `provision()` therefore posts EXACTLY `{ protocol, jobId,
 * leaseTtlSec }` to the daemon and nothing else — no env, no image, no egress
 * allowlist, no limits. The daemon fetches the job's policy itself from the
 * middleware's job-policy endpoint and derives it from the `dev_repos` row
 * (spec §4, review finding S3: "a clamp that trusts caller-supplied policy is
 * not a clamp"). The wire schema (`daemonProtocol.ts`) enforces the exact shape
 * at both ends; a body smuggling extra keys is rejected before any handler runs.
 *
 * Contract mirror (LocalProcessBackend): a teardown that does NOT prove the
 * resource is gone must surface and RETAIN the handle. `terminate()` treats a
 * daemon 404 as success (the container is already gone, idempotent) but a `502
 * daemon.cleanup_failed` is re-thrown with the handle kept so the caller retries
 * — never dropping the only handle on a live, possibly credential-bearing
 * container. `reap()` returns the handles the middleware still tracks that the
 * daemon no longer knows about, so the worker finalizes those jobs `stalled`.
 *
 * Every daemon call is bearer-authenticated, bounded by one timeout that spans
 * headers AND the body read, refuses redirects, and caps the response body — the
 * daemon lives on an internal network, but the client is not the weak end
 * (spec §5, mirroring `sidecars/dev-runner-daemon/src/policyClient.mjs`).

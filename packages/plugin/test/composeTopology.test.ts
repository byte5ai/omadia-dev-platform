/**
 * Epic #470 W1 — the dev-platform compose overlay's SECURITY properties, asserted
 * against the file rather than trusted to a reviewer's eye.
 *
 * Every claim below is one a comment could make and be wrong about. A stray
 * `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` on the middleware, or a
 * `ports:` on the privileged dind, undoes the whole design silently — the stack
 * comes up, every test passes, and the isolation is gone. These assertions are the
 * only thing standing between "the middleware never holds a docker socket" being
 * an architectural invariant and being a sentence in a README.
 *
 * Parsed, not grepped: `docker compose config` would need docker, and a grep for
 * `privileged` cannot tell you WHICH service carries it.
 */

/**
 * P4 note — WHERE THE TWO FILES LIVE NOW.
 *
 * The overlay moved into this repository with the sidecars it builds; the BASE
 * `docker-compose.yaml` is still omadia core's and always will be. So the
 * overlay is resolved from this repo's root and the base from a core checkout
 * named by `OMADIA_CORE_DIR` — the same variable `_helpers/coreSchema.ts`
 * already uses to find core's migrations, and the one CI sets.
 *
 * Without a core checkout the base-file assertions SKIP, loudly and by name,
 * rather than silently shrinking to the overlay-only subset. Every claim below
 * that spans both files is one where a silent shrink would leave a real hole:
 * "only dev-dind is privileged" is worth nothing if it only ever looked at the
 * file that declares dev-dind.
